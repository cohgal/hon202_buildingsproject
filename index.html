				div.multi-column-3
					p Get your fill of more CSS Grid items in this collection. There are a total of 32 pens to date... well, 33, if you count this one too. What can you expect in this collection? The hidden gems, in my totally  unbiased opinion, are 
						a(href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/wbyVWr" target="_blank") the recreation of the Pac-Man layout
						|  and  
						a(href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/pen/wbyVWr" target="_blank") coupons inspired by junk mail
						|. A lot of joke items of things that shouldn't be done in CSS Grid, such as 
						a(href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/PXGgMG" target="_blank") a shelf
						| ?   
						a(href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/qggOog" target="_blank") Bathroom tiles wtf
						| ? and  
						a(href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/bOWqbj" target="_blank") makeup palettes 
						| . If you are a cultured person, you will have a chance to enjoy a couple of pens inspired by 
						a(href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/JxVZpX" target="_blank") Harry Potter  
						| and  
						a(href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/RwNdeeQ" target="_blank") Pokemon.
						|  On the rare occasion that you are looking at this profile for something you can use in production, you really shouldn't. But, there are 
						em  some   
						| real-world applications, such as 
						a(href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/GPXozx" target="_blank") the recipe layout
						| ,   
						a(href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/pqoEoJ" target="_blank") the product catalog
